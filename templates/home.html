    <h2 style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      'Hello and welcome in.'<br>
      My name is Theodore (ted) Hopkins and this will be my final course within the DTSC program at Eastern University.
      I love to play soccer and games in my free time as well as find new an interesting foods and restaurants to try. I've always been interested 
      in facts and how things fit together, thats probably why I was drawn to biology initially.

    <p>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Academic Background</h2>
    <p>

      I attended Montgomery commmunity college before trasnfering to Frostburg State university graduating with a BS in Biology.
      Many of the upper classes were focused on genetics, micro-biology, and molecular biology.
      While Biotech has been an interesting field, I wanted to add a skill set that could be beneficial to all fields 

    <p>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Career Aspirations</h2>
    <p>

      While I have enjoyed most of the past 7 years working in biotech, majority of which was within the Virology department (covid was crazy) I am looking
      forward to a career within a different space. During that time I've worked with covid studies, genetherapies, cancer therapies, thyroid medications, and 
      thousands of other products. However with how the market has changed and certain global geopolitical road blocks on infastructure, trade, manufacturing, 
      and product chains, I have unfortunatly been one of many who were recently laid off. Thankfully I was not idle and by completing this degree have a chance 
      to branch out into other fields including cyber security, finance, health data analytics, or just about any other data related roles.
